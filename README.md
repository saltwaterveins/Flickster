# Project 1 - *Flickster*

**Flickster** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **~3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [x] Customize the UI.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Did anyone try collection view and want to help me?
2. Did anyone try making a search function and want to help me?

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:
